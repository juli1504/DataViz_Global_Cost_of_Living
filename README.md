# <p align=center> EcoPulse </p>

Our project, entitled EcoPulse, aims to analyse the evolution of the global economy from 1970 to 2021 by studying the impact of structural factors on countries' GDP.
It offers powerful tools to compare the economic evolution of different countries over time across four aspects :
- GDP evolution
- Import/export dynamics
- Demographic situation
- Sectoral distribution of GDP
  
EcoPulse also enables to focus on the economic situation of a particular country.
